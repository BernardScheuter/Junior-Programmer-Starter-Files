I know this and the changelog is all written very low level/simpel.
But it's to prove I know what I'm talking about and maybe more important, that I know WHY we use OOP.
For me there is no other way to show what I've learned.
I can't share the code etc. from my previous employer for obvious reasons and I had not a lot of time to code on the side in that moment in time... 

Anyway for the changes in this project, check the changelog.

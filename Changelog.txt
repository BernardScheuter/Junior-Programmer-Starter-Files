- I skipped a couple of exercises, going through the complete course to add missing bits and pieces to the project.
- Update to the data persistence mission, adding a highscore to complete the exercise

- Adjusted the start screen of the project to the "Menu" scene.
- Abstraction update (See Readme.txt or https://github.com/BernardScheuter/Junior-Programmer-Starter-Files )
- Encapsulation update (See Readme.txt or https://github.com/BernardScheuter/Junior-Programmer-Starter-Files )

Details:
Abstraction update:
- Added new methods to UserControl.cs script:
	HandleSelection
		Everything that was crammed under the Mouse 0 button(Left), has moved here.
	HandleAction
		Everything that was stuffed under the Mouse 1 button(Right), has moved here.
  Instead of copy/pasting the code everywhere, you can call the HandleSelection() or HandleAction() method.

Encapsulation update:
- MainManager.cs:
 	rewritten: "public static MainManager Instance;" to "public static MainManager Instance { get; private set; }
	So other classes can "get" the value, but not "set" it, it can be only set within this class.
	The "variable" is rewritten to a "property"!
